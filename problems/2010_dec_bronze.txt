Problem 11: Book Club [Rob Kolstad, 2010]

Bessie is looking for cows to join her book club. While the herd
has N (2 <= N <= 50,000) cows conveniently numbered 1..N, she wants
only the most discerning and social cows for her book club.

Thus, like a dating service, she has created a questionnaire and
asked each of the N cows to complete its NQ (1 <= NQ <= 50) questions
(named R_1..R_NQ). These are questions like "How much do you enjoy
reading science fiction?" and each answer is an integer in the range
1..5.

Your job is to tabulate the questionnaire's results and answer a
simple question like: "How many cows answered 2 to question 3, 4
to question 7, and also 1 to question 8?"  The question has P parts
(1 <= P <= 10), and each part has Qj (1 <= Qj <= NQ) and Aj (1 <=
Aj <= 5), respectively the question number and the required answer.
Your program prints a single integer that is the total number of
cows that answered Aj to Qj for j in the range 1..P.

Consider a small herd of just 4 cows and a small questionnaire of
just 5 questions; the responses are:

Cow     Question
 ID   1  2  3  4  5
 1    1  1  1  1  1
 2    1  2  3  4  5
 3    1  2  1  2  3
 4    2  1  1  2  2

If the tabulation question was "How many cows answered 2 to question
1 and 1 to question 2?" the answer would be 1 (just cow #4). If the
tabulation question was "How many cows answered 1 to question 1 and
1 to question 3?" the answer would be 2 (cows 1 and 3).

PROBLEM NAME: bookclub

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, NQ, and P

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains NQ space-separated integers that are
        the response to the questions for cow i: R_1..R_NQ

* Lines N+2..N+1+P: Line j+N+1 contains two space-separated integers:
        Qj and Aj

Problem 12: Bad Random Numbers [Richard V. Andree, 1965]

Bessie is trying to generate random numbers. She stumbled upon an
old reference to the 'middle square' method for making numbers that
appear to be random. It works like this:

        * Pick a starting four digit number (1 <= N <= 9999)

        * Extract its middle two digits (the hundreds and tens digit)
          as a number

        * Compute the square of those two digits

    * That square is the 'random number' and becomes the new
      starting number

Here's a sample:

                Num  Middle  Square
               7339    33     1089
               1089     8       64
                 64     6       36
                 36     3        9
                  9     0        0
                  0     0        0

The 'pigeon hole principle' tells us that the random numbers surely
must repeat after no more than 10,000 of them -- and the sequence
above repeats after just six numbers (the next number and all
subsequent numbers are 0).

Note that some sequences repeat in a more complex way; this one
alternates back and forth between 576 and 3249:

                Num  Middle  Square
                2245   24      576  
                 576   57     3249 
                3249   24      576  

Your job is to tell Bessie the count of 'random numbers' that can
be generated from a starting number before the sequence repeats
a previously seen number. In the first case above, the answer is
'6'. In the 'alternating' case, the answer is '3'.

PROBLEM NAME: badrand

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N

SAMPLE INPUT (file badrand.in):

7339

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer that is the count of iterations through the
        middle square random number generator before a previous value
        is repeated

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file badrand.out):

6

Problem 13: Adding Commas [Traditional, 2010]

Bessie is working with large numbers N (1 <= N <= 2,000,000,000) 
like 153920529 and realizes that the numbers would be a lot easier
to read with commas inserted every three digits (as is normally     
done in the USA; some countries prefer to use periods every three
digits). Thus, she would like to add commas: 153,920,529 .  Please
write a program that does this.

PROBLEM NAME: commas

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N

SAMPLE INPUT (file commas.in):

153920529

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer N with commas inserted before each set of three
        digits except the first digits (as traditionally done in many
        cultures)

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file commas.out):

153,920,529
